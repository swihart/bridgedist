Description: An implementation of the bridge distribution with logit-link in R.
    In Wang and Louis (2003), such a bridge distribution was derived as the distribution of
    the random intercept that facilitated having a conditional logistic regression that when
    marginalized by integrating out the random intercept left a marginal logistic regression,
    and the conditional and marginal regression coefficients are a scalar multiple of each other.
