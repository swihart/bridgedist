Description: An implementation of the bridge distribution with logit-link in
    R. In Wang and Louis (2003) <DOI:10.1093/biomet/90.4.765>, such a univariate
    bridge distribution was derived as the distribution of the random intercept that
    'bridged' a marginal logistic regression and a conditional logistic regression.
    The conditional and marginal regression coefficients are a scalar multiple
    of each other. Such is not the case if the random intercept distribution was
    Gaussian.
